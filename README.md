Portfolio Overview

This repository serves as a technical portfolio of academic and personal projects in digital hardware design, VLSI systems, and CAD-oriented computing.
The work emphasizes RTL design, ASIC implementation flows, FPGA-style prototyping concepts, computer architecture exploration, and EDA automation, with a strong focus on design correctness, methodology, and architectural clarity.

Several projects demonstrate end-to-end RTL-to-implementation workflows, including synthesis, physical design scripting, timing analysis, and generation of post-route deliverables.

Repository Structure
ASIC

Contains RTL design projects and a complete ASIC RTL-to-physical-design flow, including:

Synthesis netlists

Multi-corner timing setup

Physical design scripts (floorplan, placement, CTS, routing)

Power intent and power grid planning

Post-route outputs (DEF and netlist)

Design-for-testability and verification artifacts

UVM-based verification environment

This directory represents the core VLSI and backend design work in the portfolio.

CAD&DSA

Contains projects at the intersection of CAD algorithms and data structures, including:

Test compression and DFT-related algorithm development

Formal verification using a DPLL-based SAT solver

Python and C++ implementations focused on algorithmic correctness and efficiency

This directory highlights EDA-oriented problem solving and automation skills.

Comp_Arch

Contains computer architecture exploration projects, including:

Branch prediction studies

Automation scripts for architectural experiments

Result analysis across multiple configurations and workloads

These projects focus on microarchitectural behavior, performance trade-offs, and experimental evaluation.

Each major directory contains its own README file explaining the intent, methodology, and outcomes of the corresponding projects.
