PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW
------------------
This repository serves as a technical portfolio of academic and personal projects in digital hardware design, VLSI systems, CAD-oriented computing, DFT. The work focuses on RTL design, ASIC implementation flows, FPGA-style prototyping concepts, computer architecture exploration, and EDA automation, with strong emphasis on design correctness, methodology, and architectural clarity.

Several projects demonstrate complete RTL-to-implementation workflows, including logic synthesis, physical design scripting, timing analysis, and generation of post-route deliverables.


REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
--------------------
ASIC
----
This directory contains RTL design projects and a complete ASIC RTL-to-physical-design flow. The work includes synthesis netlists, multi-corner timing setup, physical design scripts covering floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing, power intent and power grid planning, post-route outputs such as DEF and netlists, and design-for-testability and verification artifacts. It also includes a UVM-based verification environment. This directory represents the core VLSI and backend design work in the portfolio.

CAD AND DSA
------------
This directory contains projects at the intersection of CAD algorithms and data structures. The work includes test compression and DFT-related algorithm development, formal verification using a DPLL-based SAT solver, and Python and C++ implementations focused on algorithmic correctness and efficiency. These projects highlight EDA-oriented problem solving and automation skills.

COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
---------------------
This directory contains computer architecture exploration projects, including branch prediction studies, automation scripts for architectural experiments, and result analysis across multiple configurations and workloads. The focus is on understanding microarchitectural behavior, performance trade-offs, and experimental evaluation.

Each major directory contains its own README file explaining the intent, methodology, and outcomes of the corresponding projects.
